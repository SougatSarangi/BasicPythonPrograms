''' PROBLEM STATEMENT'''
''' 
Virus Outbreak (100 Marks)
In the Martian land faraway, a new virus has evolved and is attacking the individuals at a fast pace. 
The scientists have figured out the virus composition, V. The big task is to identify the people who 
are infected. The sample of N people is taken to check if they are POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. A report is 
generated which provides the current blood composition B of the person. 


POSITIVE or NEGATIVE ?

If the blood composition of the person is a subsequence of the virus composition V, then the person is
identified as POSITIVE otherwise NEGATIVE.

Example:

Virus Composition, V = coronavirus
Blood Composition of the person , B = ravus
The person in question is POSITIVE as B is the subsequence of the V.
 
The scientists are busy with their research for medicine and request you to build a program which can 
quickly figure out if the person is POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. They will provide you with the virus 
composition V and all the peopleâ€™s current blood composition. Can you help them?


Note: The virus and blood compositions are lowercase alphabet strings.

Input Format:
- The first line of the input consists of the virus composition, V
- The second line of he input consists of the number of people, N
- Next N lines each consist of the blood composition of the ith person, Bi

Constraints:
- 1<= N <=10
- 1<= |B|<= |V|<= 10^5

Output Format:
- For each person, print POSITIVE or NEGATIVE in a separate line
